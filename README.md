#### What?

I'm not sure yet. This mod works to reduce the memory usage of the game after startup by compacting various
data structures (primarily in block state and block model objects.)

In case it wasn't obvious enough, let me also put this in big scary letters.

:warning: **DO NOT USE THIS IN WORLDS YOU CARE ABOUT.** There may be serious problems. This entire mod was constructed
in one night.
